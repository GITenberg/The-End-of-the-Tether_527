description: A sea-faring man all his life, Captain Whalley's change in fortunes sees
  him captaining a steady, sturdy steamer, the Sofala, for a grasping and unpleasant
  owner--Whalley's only choice if he is to continue to support his family. But Captain
  Whalley is becoming increasingly unfit for the post and an ambitious young mate
  has seen his chance to progress. However, Massy, the increasingly dissatisfied owner
  of the Sofala, has sabotage in mind.
